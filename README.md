# nba-sentiment
This project aims at performing sentiment analysis based on comments of NBA Game Threads on the r/nba subreddit.

So far, get_comments_df can be used to return a pandas Dataframe of primary level comments that can be sorted using Reddit's sorting options and queried with keywords.

In order to access the api, you need to obtain a client id and client secret by creating a new script app on reddit.

Disclaimer: Please be advised that some Reddit comments may contain explicit content.
