The key adjustment to start was Draymond playing on the ball more than Curry. Lakers adjusted this by going small, and somehow had Dennis, and other players on Dray besides Vando. When GSW took our Draymond, LAL took charge with Dennis leading the offense, supported by Reaves, Lonnie, Rui, and AD.

He went with Reaves, Dennis, Lonnie, Rui, & AD; and then swapped in LeBron back into the line-up. 

Lonnie was basically in charge of drive-in, draw the help-d, and dishing it back to the open man, something that LeBron couldn't do against Wiggins in Q1. It would seem that for LAL to get a run, Lonnie might be once again crucial to beat this GSW set up.
