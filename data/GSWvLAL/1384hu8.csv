Basically, to be quite honest Draymond is a great post defender (without delving into how much allowance the refs give him - he is actually great)

Rather than spam Davis Post-ups, they‚Äôre running a ton of pick and rolls and giving Davis wide open looks around 8-10 feet from the basket.

He‚Äôs made 1, missed 5. He got one put back dunk. 

Without Looney going hard at AD or the boards Lakers arent accruing easy fouls. And we‚Äôre shooting (and thankfully making) a lot more outside shots.

It‚Äôs a little easier to get layups for Bron right now cutting to the basket now that the floor is open. But to get the win Lakers are gonna have to go at Draymond a little harder. Warriors have Klay going but Curry‚Äôs got all the attention and he‚Äôs passing instead.
