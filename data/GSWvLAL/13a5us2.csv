jj65ml7,"No one cares, but I‚Äôm gonna dump my thoughts on the game here.

AD was phenomenal. Aggressive and active on both ends of the floor and it seemed like he had a hand in almost every stop the lakers got. The question is if he can maintain this quality of play on an even numbered game, which he hasn‚Äôt done yet. G4 is in crypto though, so hopefully the role guys pick up wherever he‚Äôs likely to lack. 

This team enables some of the most exciting play I‚Äôve seen out of LeBron in years. Everyone can create their own shot, so LeBron puts significantly more effort on defense, and it shows. The numbers support it and the eye test confirms it: LeBron is a top 3 defender this playoffs, and the only 2 ahead of him join him in the front court. (Statistically, I think he‚Äôs actually rated 4th in defensive rating, but I can‚Äôt remember who the #3 guy actually is) On offense he‚Äôs still the Swiss Army knife he always is, but he‚Äôs noticeably quieter on that end, but it‚Äôs for the better.

The three man guard rotation of schroder, reaves, and russell is sensational. The offense speaks for itself, but defensively, they all understand their assignments perfectly. They put in phenomenal effort and put guys like AD, LeBron, and Vando in the position to succeed on that end. 

On that note, I‚Äôd like the give credit to Ham. The rotations were a mess early on, but they‚Äôve been much tighter in the postseason. (my heart leaps for joy seeing Brown stay on the bench) He‚Äôs recognized that AD is an absolute black hole on defense, and he‚Äôs given the guards the assignment of guiding the offense towards him. When AD sits, the size match up of LeBron/Vando/Rui still maintain significant impact in the paint, though obviously not to AD‚Äôs extent. 

This deserves its own comment bc of how successful it‚Äôs been. Vando is guarding Curry as well as I‚Äôve ever seen anyone do before. It‚Äôs a team effort, as it always is with Curry, but I have much more confidence in that scheme with Vando at the head of the spear. 

DLo was hot, my question is can he stay hot? He seems to have been pretty consistent since early I. The Grizzlies series, but his body language always concerns me. The moment seems to get to him more than the rest of the team. I can‚Äôt complain especially after that performance, I just hope he can maintain the confidence, because he‚Äôs absolutely dominant with a level head. 

Rui, AR, and Schroder are always ready for the moment. Any lack of production does not indicate a lack of impact. The effort is always there and they‚Äôre always on top of it whenever the game allows them to get to their spots. If the Lakers make it to the CF, this bench unite will be HUGE, bc they either need to keep up with Denver‚Äôs bench to give the starters a chance, or they need to win the series outright against the Suns. 

I have little to say about the Warriors. The adjustment to me seems to use Curry‚Äôs gravity to enable the team the same way he did in G2. That said, it seemed like that was the gameplan anyways, but AD was just getting in front of every single pass attempt. 

2 years ago my adjustment would be simple. Run the offense through Dray. However, his scoring production has dropped significantly and as a result, he has little to no gravity as the ball handler. He‚Äôs never been an elite scorer, but in the past he has been enough of a threat to draw just enough attention away from Steph and Klay to get them shots. Now, his only skill set seems to be his ability to get other guys the ball, but if they can‚Äôt get it going, he does little to nothing to ease the load. 

I will close with the most obvious takeaway: Poole is absolutely shell shocked since G1. He normally plays with superstar confidence, and I had no issue with him taking a superstar shot at the end of the game, but superstars also need to play with a short memory. You can‚Äôt let a moment like that get to your head. 

If GS wants to have a chance at winning this series, he needs to play with a head on his shoulders otherwise the rest of the team is going to be continually isolated as he struggles to produce. You can count on superstars to carry the weight, but you need to get it onto their shoulders first, and as of G3, the warriors failed to do that",91,1683430941.0,t3_13a5us2
