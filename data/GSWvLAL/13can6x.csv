Kerr went back to the principle of basic 1-3-1 zonal attack. No matter what happens, someone must cut to the low post if a penetration is made, and Lakers are getting obliterated having to defend the 3, and the paint.

This is probably made to deter AD from pushing his drop coverage from the first pick and roll. GSW doesn't do mid-range. They only go into the paint, or shoot from 3pt, and man, quite a good chess game we have here.",34,1683602648.0,t3_13can6x

I truly believe Jordon Poole is intentionally trying to ruin the Warrior's playoff chances. His play has been lackluster and atp intentionally bad, some of these turnovers are borderline on purpose. Last Playoffs he was playing great giving the team quality minutes but his immaturity from having less playing time and getting socked by draymond green has ultimately dictated his play. Every time he comes into the game it's just silly mistakes over and over again which is super unusual considering he is a really good player with a straight bag.
