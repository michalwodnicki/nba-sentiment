Who would expect Caleb Martin (who averaged 24% in 3PT shoots in his last season before joining the Heat) and Strus (averaged like 3 minutes on the floor or somewhere around there with the Bulls) to be game deciding factors in a ECF game? No data analysts could ever see that shit, but only an experienced coach's eye. The rest of the franchises need to start trusting coaches a little bit more and allowing them to build the teams instead of just coaching them, because it feels like in most cases (with some exceptions, like the GSW) the GMs and the coaches are contradicting or at least tolerating each other instead of collaborating.

jklli30,Joe needs to take Rob Williams out of lineup and put in Grant Williams. He’s got the bulk and the length to be better defensively against Butler who routinely was seeking out Rob to switch onto him. Once he got what he wanted it was a guaranteed wet jump shot every time. Whatever rebounding is lost will hopefully be helped by having someone in the floor who shoots 3’s at a near 40% clip which would in turn give better spacing. If this isn’t done then Celtics are actively trying to tank Williams value. There is no reason to be giving minutes to Pritchard who Jimmy Butler can just shoot right over with ease. Blows my mind Grant didn’t get any time tonight.,2,1684387061.0,t3_13khtbi
