They're built around their defense and they can be absolutely suffocating. This is a direct credit to Spoelstra, because he's an absolute mad scientist.

They win the psychological game because they're able to apply so much pressure at times. When their defense generates offense they can go on big runs, and when things slow down they've got Butler to hit tough shots and keep them in it. Plus, whenever they need it, and seemingly at will, Butler can dig deep and take over the game.

Their role players are reliable AF. They're hitting open 3's and even some of the contested ones. And the whole team is out there diving on the floor and clogging the passing lanes and just flat out hustling nonstop.

So far a disaster for the Celtics and totally unexpected given the seeming talent disparity.

All that said this series is not over. Boston seemingly plays better in these situations. They have dug themselves a big hole no doubt, maybe too big. But for some reason these Celtics seem to play better on the road. They will win one of the next two maybe both. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they tie it up 2-2 and then lose game 5 in Boston.
