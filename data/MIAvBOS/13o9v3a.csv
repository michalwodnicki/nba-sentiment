jl3jvkt,"if tatum learned how to jump stop on drives, he would be such a better scorer. both tatum and a lot of the celtics have a bad tendency of jump passing on drives where they don't like the shot. 

that's a huge fundamental of basketball that is taught early to never get caught passing while in the air. i feel like that's where we have seen the maturity of butler vs tatum in scoring. butler does not drive to the paint aimlessly, but nearly always jump stops and makes a pass, pivot, or shot. 

we also see this all the time when tatum drives from the right elbow to the left block where he reverse layups with his right hand fading away from the basket. i remember seeing it a ton in the warriors finals and him missing a ton of good drives. if he just jump stopped he would get so many better shots and passes",3,1684716619.0,t3_13o9v3a

jl3ue44,"Not to take away anything from what the Heat have accomplished, but this playoffs has really made the regular season look like a joke.

Denver is the only team that turned out to be a traditional playoff powerhouse by following up on strong and consistent regular season play.  It turns out you can fuck around for 82 games.  If you have no incentive to tank, you'll probably at least make the play-in.  From there, you always have a chance as long as your team is in better health than your opponent.

In other words, the playoffs got way more exciting and less predictable at the expense of the regular season having very little meaning.",2,1684721598.0,t3_13o9v3a
