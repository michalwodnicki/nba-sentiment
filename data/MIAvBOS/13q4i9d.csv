I just seems like such a no brainer. Competitive wise there's nothing to play for anymore. Yes is POSSIBLE that the team down 0-3 could come back but it's as close to an impossibility as it gets. 

The only thing that can be accomplished by playing extra games at that point is making the team that's up more tired. 

And what's the benefit of tiring Denver or The Heat out (or any team for that matter) that's already ""beat"" it's opponent? Increasing the likelihood of a key player getting injured? Making the next series less competitive due to increased fatigue? Making the next series less competitive due to one team being worn out from playing 1-2 extra pointless games? 

Just like the NBA insisting on a 82 game season because of nothing else that pure greed, them forcing teams who've already showed dominance over it's opponent is dumb.
