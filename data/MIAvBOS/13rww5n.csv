If Boston played with this defensive intensity all series, this is the closeout game. 

When Boston locks in defensively, Miami is so HILARIOUSLY outclassed it isn't even fun. 

Miami is out of their depth IF they get the ""can you believe our heads ARENT up our asses?"" Celtics.

Still not confident Celtics can keep this up in game 6, IF they win, and I still have Miami in 6. 

But if they bring this defense, Miami may lose by double digits the rest of the series.

jlndple,"It starts with success.

And success, is all about growing.

Success is all about overcoming your demons, success is about getting knocked down, time after time, and getting back up. No one embodies that more than Jimmy Butler

Butler. He is one of the most experienced and celebrated players in NBA and the World, but regardless of that resum√©, he has never won an international trophy, but he has never lost his drive.

And what's more is that even in the last couple of years ago, even making a Championship Final seemed out of reach.

Until 2020, everything was set up to perfection for Butler and for Heat. They reconquered the East after years of Bucks domination, Butler stepped up as a true carry, and they faced a Lakers in the Finals they had beaten twice in the group stage. But as we all know, it was a tragedy, it was a quick exit. It was a shameful display, and what was worse, it felt like a lost opportunity that may never come again, for Butler , for Miami and for East.

The West rose as the unbeateable beast we know them to be. And the west would dominate the World Championship two times in a row. But Butler, he did not stop fighting, and in fact in 2022, he was finally able to put one of his biggest demons to bed, with Bam and old man lowry.

And now? Now we're here. 2023 .Where the expectations for Miami were at their lowest ahead of this best of seven versus Celtics, the 2nd seed from the east. The team that has beaten miami down in these best of sevens, time and time again; and Tatum, standing tall and poised to win his second Eastern Conference Championship.

But so far we haven't gotten Celtics domination, we haven't gotten the Tatum highlight reels, and we've gotten Butler and Caleb Martin lane kingdom.

It all comes down to this next game. Demons can be slayed, expectations be damned, and Butler can cement himself as the player he always wanted to prove he was.

In this next game. It's all up to him and Miami to make their dreams come true.",0,1685067635.0,t3_13rww5n
