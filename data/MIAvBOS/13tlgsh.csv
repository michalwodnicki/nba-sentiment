Edit: Idk why i‚Äôm getting downvoted. It was a simple question that I wanted to pose, because there have been instances where officials have reviewed game clock and determined that the clock didn‚Äôt start accordingly and ruled a game as being over, or the more/less time should‚Äôve come off and they adjust for it.

In a game that ends due to a 0.1 second [potential] clock discrepancy, that could be a huge deal. However, with a new post coming out today about in-arena game clocks vs on-TV game clocks not being fully synced, this was likely the issue.",-7,1685245821.0,t3_13tlgsh
