Said that Jalen Brown and Jayson Tatum were both huge Family Matters fans and would often recite lines from memory back and forth after making shots. One time, after showering, Tatum pulled his shorts up to his nipples and pretended to be Urkel while Jaylen Brown found a wig somewhere (!?) and played a convincing Lisa. They recreated an entire scene from the second season, but when Tatum started hopping over to Brown and nasally whining ""I'm wearing you down! I'm wearing you down!"" Brown suddenly threw the wig down and stormed out, towel still around his waist, and everyone was like ""Yo what just happened? We were having so much laughs."" Tatum looked down and quietly whispered to himself, ""Did I do that?"" But the team wasn't sure if he was staying in character or not.

They played hard the next three games and forced a game 7. Then they became arrogant because they were on a 3-0 comeback run going home so they felt they didn’t need to play then they lose.

jm599to,"At halftime in the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, the Miami Heat hold a solid 52-41 lead over the Boston Celtics. The Heat have displayed an impressive performance thus far, showcasing their offensive prowess and defensive resilience. However, with an entire half left to play, the Celtics will likely make adjustments to mount a comeback and challenge the Heat's lead.  
  
The Celtics are known for their resilience and ability to make strategic adjustments during halftime, and they will undoubtedly come out with a renewed sense of purpose in the second half. Expect their star players, such as Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, to step up their game and provide a much-needed offensive spark. They will likely employ a more aggressive defensive strategy to disrupt the Heat's rhythm and close the scoring gap.  
  
On the other hand, the Heat will look to maintain their momentum and capitalize on their first-half success. Led by their dynamic duo of Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, the Heat will continue to attack the Celtics' defense and utilize their strong perimeter shooting. Their solid teamwork and disciplined approach will be crucial in fending off the Celtics' comeback attempts.  
  
Both teams will battle intensely in the second half, with high stakes on the line. The Heat will strive to extend their lead and secure a decisive victory, allowing them to move one step closer to the NBA Finals. The Celtics, however, will be fighting for their playoff lives, determined to turn the tide and force a Game 7.  
  
As the second half unfolds, expect a highly competitive and thrilling contest between two talented teams. The outcome of this game will heavily depend on each team's ability to make adjustments, execute their game plan, and showcase their skills under pressure. Basketball fans can anticipate a captivating finish to the Eastern Conference Finals as the Heat and Celtics battle it out for a spot in the NBA Finals.",14,1685410109.0,t3_13va0qi

This trade marks a significant shake-up for both teams and has garnered considerable attention throughout the league.  
  
The Portland Trail Blazers, looking to bolster their roster and maximize their championship aspirations, have opted to part ways with their high draft pick in favor of acquiring an established and talented player in Jaylen Brown. Brown, a rising star in the league, has showcased his skills and versatility as a key contributor for the Celtics. With his ability to score, defend, and contribute in various aspects of the game, Brown brings a valuable skill set to the Blazers.  
  
On the other side of the trade, the Boston Celtics gain a valuable asset in the number 3 pick, providing them an opportunity to select a highly touted prospect in the NBA draft. With this pick, the Celtics can potentially add a promising young player to their roster, either to further strengthen their team or potentially use as a trade asset in future moves.  
  
The trade signifies the ambitions and strategic decisions made by both teams. The Blazers are looking to make immediate improvements to their roster to contend for a championship, while the Celtics seek to enhance their future prospects with a high draft pick. This trade also reflects the value placed on Jaylen Brown, who is seen as a key piece in the Celtics' plans and now becomes a prominent figure in the Blazers' future.  
  
As the NBA draft approaches, fans and analysts alike will be eagerly watching to see which prospect the Celtics select with the number 3 pick and how Jaylen Brown's departure impacts both teams' performances next season. This trade adds another layer of excitement and intrigue to the NBA landscape, with the potential to shape the futures of the Portland Trail Blazers and Boston Celtics in significant ways.",2,1685411617.0,t3_13va0qi

jm7hnmq,"I would like Miami to win the finals for two reasons:

1. People will put an asterisk on Denver’s chip for beating a 7 seed and an 8 seed in the final 2 rounds. This is unfair to Denver, but it’s the way people are. Obviously I’ll still be happy for Denver’s players should they do what they’re supposed to do. I’m just considering the optics from stupid people with loud voices. 

2. Miami will be an 8 seed who wins it all with wins over a 1, 5, 2, and 1 seed. There will be less of an asterisk on Miami, unless people count Giannis’ injury (valid) and Tatum’s ankle roll in game 7 (also valid). Miami would still at least be an 8 seed making history.",-12,1685457922.0,t3_13va0qi
