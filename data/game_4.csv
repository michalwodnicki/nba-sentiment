Kerr went back to the principle of basic 1-3-1 zonal attack. No matter what happens, someone must cut to the low post if a penetration is made, and Lakers are getting obliterated having to defend the 3, and the paint.

This is probably made to deter AD from pushing his drop coverage from the first pick and roll. GSW doesn't do mid-range. They only go into the paint, or shoot from 3pt, and man, quite a good chess game we have here.",29,1683602648.0,t3_13can6x

jjfbrd4,Gotta find a solution to the Warriors pulling AD out the paint with their PnR. Golden State gonna win this game if the Lakers can't figure it out,7,1683602307.0,t3_13can6x
jjfbsda,"Lakers have fumbled the game so far. Not playing aggressive on offense and driving the ball instead launching long middies and 3s. Super lazy D and late rotations, you know AD is on the perimeter, they're probably looking for a back door

Good gameplan by warriors so far",9,1683602322.0,t3_13can6x
